### Background

I've gotten a lot of inspiration from youtube channels like [Sebastion Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague), [Code Parade](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeParade), [Emergent Garden](https://www.youtube.com/@EmergentGarden/videos), [Reducible](https://www.youtube.com/@Reducible), [JLaservideo](https://www.youtube.com/@JLaservideo), and [Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere). Spoiler alert, I really like computer graphics and robotics, so expect a lot of content related to those domains. I am not mentally prepared to jump into creating a youtube channel, so this blog will have to suffice as a means for documenting my journey through various projects.

I love to build things from the ground up using code, as I find it's a great way to learn something deeply and you come to appreciate it a lot more. I compare it to stringing together a website using various JavaScript libraries vs. building it from scratch in raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If the end product is all you care about, then definitely save yourself the headache and use the libraries that have been built for that exact reason. But if you want to explore the inner workings of how something like a website works, then there's no better way than jumping in and building it with as minimal dependencies as possible. Things seem less magical this way :)

Don't get me wrong, abstraction is a beautiful thing (and often necessary for building complex systems), but sometimes it is nice to get into the nitty gritty and understand exactly how things are happening behind the scenes.

My hope is that this blog may inspire someone to go out and create something, much like the youtube channels I listed above have inspired me to create.

### The Plan

I'm an ideas man, and what this means is that I have a ton of project ideas that I bounce between and never actually commit to. This blog is almost a means of keeping myself accountable. With that said, I will likely structure projects into series of blog posts, starting from project setup and going through major milestones of the project, and finally a concluding post discussing the finished product and what I learned.

There may be a few singular blog posts here and there addressing specific issues I came across, or ideas I found intriguing, that I think would be beneficial for a viewer to see in a general context. But for the most part, expect to see blogs about projects I am working on.

I have no clue how well I will stick to this plan, so this post may be updated in the future if I find a better way of doing things. With that said, hope you enjoy what I put out there, and maybe something will be of use to you!
